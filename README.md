# TriageXpert: An AI-Powered Medical Pre-Screening Platform

## Introduction

TriageXpert is a proof-of-concept web application engineered to perform preliminary medical pre-screening. The system leverages a sophisticated architecture combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) with advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze user-reported symptoms against their unique medical profile. The objective is to produce a structured, informational report that assists users in understanding the potential urgency of their health concerns and identifying appropriate next steps.

This project emphasizes privacy (no data storage), accessibility (mobile-friendly), and professional medical disclaimers. It's built as a Flask web app with client-side JavaScript for interactivity and server-side Python for API integration.

### Key Objectives
- Assist users in understanding symptom urgency (Emergency, Urgent, Routine).
- Deliver Gemini-generated, structured health assessments with clinical summaries, differential diagnoses, and care plans.
- Promote preventive health through curated tips and tools.

## Core Features

- **AI-Powered Triage Tool**: Analyze symptoms with patient profile (age, gender, BMI, history) to generate triage category, confidence score, and detailed Gemini API-based assessment.
- **Professional Results Display**: Clinical-grade interface with sections for summary, immediate actions, differential diagnosis, warning signs, follow-up plans, lifestyle advice, and disclaimers.
- **Preventive Health Hub**: Interactive cards with dynamic, API-loaded tips for monsoon health, heart care, and diabetes prevention.
- **BMI Calculator**: Instant body mass index calculation with categorized advice.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggleable theme with localStorage persistence, text color adjustments, and icon visibility (moon/sun).
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized with hover effects, animations, and keyboard accessibility.
- **Privacy-Focused**: No database; all processing is ephemeral.
- **Gemini API Integration**: Generates personalized, structured medical explanations based on user input.
- **Portable Document Generation**: Users can export their report as a PDF document, providing a portable and easily shareable summary for consultation with healthcare providers.

## System Architecture and Workflow

TriageXpert is implemented with a multi-stage architecture designed to ensure a logical and context-aware analysis pipeline.

1.  **User Interaction Layer:** A clean, intuitive frontend developed with standard web technologies captures user data through a guided, multi-step workflow.
2.  **API and Orchestration Layer:** A Flask-based backend serves as the central orchestrator, managing data flow between the user interface and the AI core. It standardizes input and prepares it for the analytical pipeline.
3.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Core:** The initial stage of analysis utilizes a specialized `ClinicalBERT` model. This model processes the user's symptom description to perform a baseline triage classification and extract medically relevant keywords.
4.  **Generative AI Reasoning Engine:** The NLP output, combined with the complete user profile, is then submitted to a Large Language Model (Google Gemini). A precisely engineered prompt instructs the model to conduct a deeper, contextual analysis, generating the human-readable explanations, warnings, and recommendations.
5.  **Report Generation and Delivery:** The final, structured JSON data is transmitted back to the user interface, where it is dynamically rendered. The system concurrently formats this data into a downloadable PDF document.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.8+, Flask (web framework), google-generativeai (Gemini API client).
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (with variables and transitions), JavaScript (vanilla for interactivity).
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini Pro model for natural language generation of health assessments; Hugging Face Transformers (`ClinicalBERT`), spaCy, NLTK for NLP.
- **Libraries**: Font Awesome (icons), Google Fonts (Poppins typography).
- **Tools**: LocalStorage for theme persistence, Fetch API for server communication, jsPDF for document generation.
- **Data Interchange**: RESTful APIs, JSON.

## Usage

1. **Home Page**: Start with symptom triage or explore health hub/BMI tool.
2. **Triage Tool**:
   - Describe symptoms and provide profile details.
   - Receive professional assessment with clinical sections.
3. **Health Hub**: Click categories for API-loaded preventive tips.
4. **Dark Mode**: Toggle via navbar icon (persists across sessions).
5. **BMI Calculator**: Input height/weight for instant results.
