# TriageXpert: An AI-Powered Medical Pre-Screening Platform

## Introduction

TriageXpert is a proof-of-concept web application engineered to perform preliminary medical pre-screening. The system leverages a sophisticated architecture combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) with advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze user-reported symptoms against their unique medical profile. The objective is to produce a structured, informational report that assists users in understanding the potential urgency of their health concerns and identifying appropriate next steps.

This application is an experimental demonstration and is **not a certified medical device**. The information generated by TriageXpert is provided for informational purposes only and does not, under any circumstances, constitute medical advice. It is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical diagnosis, treatment, or consultation. Users should always seek the advice of a qualified health provider for any medical conditions or health concerns.

## Core Features

*   **Contextual AI Analysis:** The system performs a nuanced analysis that extends beyond simple keyword matching by integrating the user's age, Body Mass Index (BMI), and pre-existing conditions. This results in a more personalized and contextually relevant preliminary report.
*   **Guided User Intake Protocol:** A multi-step user interface systematically collects essential demographic data, medical history, and symptoms to construct a comprehensive profile for the AI-driven assessment.
*   **Structured Health Reporting:** Upon analysis, the application generates a standardized report that includes the following components:
    *   **Triage Classification:** A designation of `Emergency`, `Urgent`, or `Routine` to indicate the assessed level of urgency.
    *   **Symptom Identification:** A list of key symptoms and medical terms extracted from the user's narrative.
    *   **Assessment Rationale:** A detailed explanation of the factors contributing to the triage classification.
    *   **Procedural Guidance:** Actionable recommendations for next steps and a list of critical indicators for seeking immediate medical assistance.
    *   **Self-Care Suggestions:** Relevant home care advice for conditions classified as non-urgent.
*   **Portable Document Generation:** Users can export their report as a PDF document, providing a portable and easily shareable summary for consultation with healthcare providers.

## System Architecture and Workflow

TriageXpert is implemented with a multi-stage architecture designed to ensure a logical and context-aware analysis pipeline.

1.  **User Interaction Layer:** A clean, intuitive frontend developed with standard web technologies captures user data through a guided, multi-step workflow.
2.  **API and Orchestration Layer:** A Flask-based backend serves as the central orchestrator, managing data flow between the user interface and the AI core. It standardizes input and prepares it for the analytical pipeline.
3.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Core:** The initial stage of analysis utilizes a specialized `ClinicalBERT` model. This model processes the user's symptom description to perform a baseline triage classification and extract medically relevant keywords.
4.  **Generative AI Reasoning Engine:** The NLP output, combined with the complete user profile, is then submitted to a Large Language Model (Google Gemini). A precisely engineered prompt instructs the model to conduct a deeper, contextual analysis, generating the human-readable explanations, warnings, and recommendations.
5.  **Report Generation and Delivery:** The final, structured JSON data is transmitted back to the user interface, where it is dynamically rendered. The system concurrently formats this data into a downloadable PDF document.
